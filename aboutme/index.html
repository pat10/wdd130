    <h2>Robert Patten</h2>

    <p>Welcome to class! I'm Robert Patten, and I'm excited to be your instructor.

    <p>I was born and raised in central California and am the oldest of five children. My dad was an optometrist, and my mom was a music teacher.

    <p>I have spent most of my adult life in Idaho. I attended Ricks College right after high school, and I returned to the new BYU-Idaho after my Spanish-speaking mission in New Jersey.</p>

    <p>Once I graduated with an English degree, I worked as a reporter and editor for local news organizations in Rexburg and Idaho Falls. Eventually, I realized the journalism industry -- like many others -- was in desperate need of people who were skilled in technology, so I earned a second bachelor's degree in information technology with an emphasis in software (programming) from Western Governors University. It was completely online.</p>

    <p>I know from experience that being an online student can be challenging. While I was pursuing my degree at WGU, I was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma and had to go through chemotherapy. (I've been in remission since 2014.) I knew furthering my education would bless my family and me, so I pushed through the bad weeks and was grateful for the good ones.</p>

    <p>Besides teaching, I work for EastIdahoNews.com as the web manager -- a title I got to create myself! I get to do a little bit of everything. I edit articles, code, traffic ads, do graphic design, manage a WordPress site, and sometimes work one on one with college interns.</p>

    <p>I met my wife, Jamie, while we were students at BYU-Idaho. We've been married since 2005 and have a teenage daughter and son who love it when I barbecue.</p>

    <p>Other things I do in my spare time (what's that?) include composing music on the computer, working on a podcast of scary stories, and programming text adventures. My two most geeky possessions are an Apple IIc and a copy of the first Harry Potter book in Latin. I'm also learning Esperanto right now because I think "useless" things are beautiful.</p>
